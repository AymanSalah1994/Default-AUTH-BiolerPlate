0-Create a New Folder for Our Environment 

1-Create New Django Project inside this folder ,and call it "config" , this will act as the main App . 

2-Now you Have a Newly Created Django Project which includes the auth app , if you do the "migration" and migrate databases  and then see the Tables inside your SQLite file , you will find out that there is a Table in your databases Called "auth_user" , This is a tables represent the Default "User" Model Created by Dajngo 

3-First include the Auth URLS inside your Main urls.py file   . 

4-Now if you Visit any Sub-URL for "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/" They work , BUT you MIGHT get an Error Because For example for "log in " We MUST Create Template for it inside a Folder called registration --> "registration/login.html"


5-Configute the Templates Folder inside your settings.py file 
// DIRS = [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates'))]

6-Now Create a 'templates' Folder . && Inside it Create "registration" folder too 


7-In this registration Folder you Will put the templates ,, Make Sure names are correct so that Django will detect them Automatically  . 
-log.html | password_reset_done.html | password_change_done.html  ....ETC 
// The Above are Examples  . 

8-If you Visit the Urls you will find NOthing , because your templates are empty , In general Keep in mind that , for login for example the LoginView will send A form Object Right ?So in your login.html file Put this form Object  to be show ,, password_change will include some kind of form  for changing password ...ETC
{{ form.as_p }} <<Writing Only this inside logn.html is Enough to show the Form on the browser . 


9-Now Just a Couple of Environment Variable that you Need to put in your settings.py file 
    -LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home' # home is a Name of a View for redirect
    -LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home' # home is a Name of a View for redirect



Q / ONE LAST remaining this , What about Sign-up ?
A / There is NO sign-up in Django , The only thing that Django Has For us About this Sign up Action is a Form Called UserCreationForm , So we will use it for our Advantage , Here is the Steps : 
    -Create new App , lets call it 'accounts' & add it to installed_apps
    -Inside urls.py in this app [Actually you Will Create this urls.py file], define a path for '/signup',Generally Configure urls properly 
    -In Views.py in this app , import UserCreationForm from the Auth app 
    -Inside views.py in this app , Create SignUpView { and Inherit this Class from CreateView so that is it a "Creation" View} And Lastly inside this View You Can Define 
        1-success_url
        2-the form_class [UserCreationForm of Course]
        3-template_name for this View 
    

 

Auth is All About those things > login ,logout , sigup, password things .
